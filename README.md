# Financial News Summarization

## Overview

This project focuses on summarizing financial news for investors in the Russian stock market. Given the increasing competition among brokerage firms, timely and structured news summaries enhance customer engagement and decision-making. The summarization model follows a hierarchical approach, first condensing individual articles and then aggregating them into a daily digest.
